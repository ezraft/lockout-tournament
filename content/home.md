## About

Lockout is a form of 1v1 competitive programming, in which participants race to solve a series of problems before each
other. The Lockout Tournament is hosted by students from various Competitive Programming clubs across the United States.

## Format

The tournament will consist of a double elimination bracket. Participants who lose in each round will be placed into a
second bracket, and the final will be played between the winners of the first and second brackets. Each round will be 30
minutes long, and will consist of 5 problems, with scoring and difficulty varying between rounds.

## Difficulty

All participants will participate in one division. Problems in earlier rounds will be USACO Bronze/Silver level, and will get more difficult as the tournament progresses.

## Schedule

The tournament will be played on Saturday, April 29th, through our Discord server. All times are in PDT (Pacific Daylight Time).
